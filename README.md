## Summary
The Line Chart truly gives us a better idea of seasonal precipitation for both June and December. We can base some decisions from this collection of summaries and charts. Precipitation was very consistent in the most year for both the months of June and December. Weather seems favorable to opening a surf shop and ice cream shop combination.
